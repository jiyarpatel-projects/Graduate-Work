### Tools & Methods
- Python
- Two-Way ANOVA
- Statistical analysis
### Overview
Randomized controlled trial analyzing whether Drug A reduces fasting sugar levels compared to placebo. 
- Enrolled: 3,400 patients across 3 clinical sites
- Sample: 1,000 patients (Simple Random Sampling)
- Duration: 10 weeks
- Groups: Placebo, Low-Dose Drug A, High-Dose Drug A

### Research Question
"Is there a significant difference in mean fasting
sugar levels among the three treatment groups (Low-Drug A, High-
Drug A, Placebo) across all three sites, and does the site location
influence treatment effectiveness?"

### Key Findings
- Treatment Group → significant (reject null)
- Site → not significant (accept null)
- Treatment x Site → (reject null)
